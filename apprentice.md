## [x] CSS Responsive Web Design
- [x] How the Dao of Web Design considers content and the styling of it
	- The nature of web is flexibility. We should embrace this flexibility, rather than trying to manhandle and control our code into hard, brittleness
- [x] The main elements of Responsive Web Design
	- Fluid Grids
	- Flexible Images
	- Media Queries
	- A Different Way of Thinking
- [x] The difference between Responsive and Adaptive Web Design
	- Adaptive: Multiple fixed-width layouts
	- Responsive: Multiple fluid grid layouts
- [x] The difference between relative units and static units
	- Relative units are proportional to the page, parent, or text element dimensions
- [x] Proficient and appropriate use of media queries in html, css, and with different media types (in source code)
- [x] The difference between "Mobile First" and "Desktop First" approaches in RWD
	- Desktop first assumes desktop as default screen size, cpu, network, full payloads, then visually hides things if mobile screen width is detected
	- Mobile first assumes the lightest payloads, least-capable device, smallest characteristics first, then adds more ability once capabilities are detected. This method creates faster desktop sites as well, since we developed for constrained capabilities first
- [x] Flexible grid-based layout
	- columns should scale to device area, and be flexible all the way from smarphone portrait, up to 4K computer monitors
	- I used CSS grid to demo this in source code
- [x] Testing RWD in mobile emulators, and debugging live mobile devices
	- [x] Chrome mobile emulation, also with real android device
	- [x] XCode mobile emulation
	- [x] Safari debugging, with a real mobile device
	- [x] Google's mobile-friendly emulator
	- [x] WPT's EZ test mode
	- [x] Lighthouse PWA tester
- [x] Teach another developer 3 things you've learned

## [x] CSS - Explorer
- [x] Discover a new & helpful CSS tool: Prettier for CSS, also stylelint
- [x] Explore & discover the tool (hasn't been covered in your required micro-badges yet)
- [x] Demonstrate the tool
- [x] Add the tool to the appropriate micro-badge curriculum (I added Prettier to the JS linting micro-badge. Seems like we need a CSS tools microbadge soon, too)
